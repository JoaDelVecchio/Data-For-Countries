# Countries Filter App

The Countries Filter App fetches a list of countries from an external API and displays them. Users can filter the countries by typing into an input field, which dynamically updates the displayed list based on the user's input. This app is built with React and demonstrates the use of functional components and hooks for state management and side effects.
